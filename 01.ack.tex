This work would not have been possible without the support of many. I would like to thank and dedicate this dissertation to the following people:

To my advisor Fernando Castor. Castor is an exceptional professor. His guidance and enthusiasm were fundamental to motivate me throughout this research.

To my co-advisor João Paulo Fernandes for his pivotal contributions to the work we have done.

To Paulo Lieuthier, Francisco Soares-Neto, and Gilberto Melfe for their numerous direct contributions to this dissertation.

To my friends, for being a part of who I am today. Special thanks go to Lucas, Tiago, Cláudio, Gustavo, Marcela, and Marina.

To my friends and colleagues from INDT. Thank you for the thought-provoking discussions, endless laughs, and beers.

To my family, especially my parents and my sister, for always supporting me through my whole life. I would not be here without them.
