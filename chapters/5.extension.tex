\section{Use \forkOn for embarrassingly parallel problems}
\sstate{Description:} Both the performance and energy consumption of a program can be improved by using \forkOn to create new threads of execution when there is little or no dependency among these threads.
\newline

\sstate{Justification:} A problem that can be decomposed into parallel tasks that do not need to communicate with each other to make progress is called \emph{embarrassingly parallel}. In this kind of problem,
% XXX: explain why this kind of problem can benefit from the use of forkOn
% XXX: show that this phenomenon occurs on your study
% XXX: talk about -qa and -qm and show some results with them enabled


% XXX: may change this tip to suggest the number of capabilities to be used?
